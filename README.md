Internet Age
============

I was completely impressed by [MeteorJS](http://www.meteor.com) when I first discovered it.  And the way I learn **any** new technology/framework/language is by building something with it.

This is my first application using [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com).

This project has made me realize Javascript has accelerated in its maturity while I was not looking.  I am an "old timer" and recall the days of 'Live Script' and played with JavaScript when it was ONLY a client-side technology. Recently, I have eschewed these "new fangled" frameworks for JS on the server.  But, as I said, Meteor turned my head.  Probably it is the structure that feels so much like Rails that offered the  biggest allure.
